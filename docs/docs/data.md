## SCoPE2 data processed to ASCII text matrices

Peptides by single cells at 1% FDR and including peptides identified by DART-ID. The first 2 columns list the corresponding protein identifiers and peptide sequences and each subsequent column corresponds to a single cell.

[Peptides-raw.csv](http://slavovlab.net/scope2/data/Peptides-raw.csv)

Proteins by single cells at 1% FDR, imputed and batch corrected.

[Proteins-processed.csv](http://slavovlab.net/scope2/data/Proteins-processed.csv)

Annotation by single cells. Each column corresponds to a single cell and the rows include relevant metadata, such as, cell type if known, measurements from the isolation of the cell, and derivative quantities, i.e., rRI, CVs, reliability.
