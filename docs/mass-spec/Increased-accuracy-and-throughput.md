To increase the throughput and quantitative accuracy of single-cell protein analysis by [SCoPE-MS](https://doi.org/10.1101/102681), we introduced many technical improvements in both the sample preparation and in the mass-spectrometry analysis. The [synergistic effect](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/12/05/665307/T1.medium.gif) is to increase quantitative accuracy by 4-fold and the throughput of data acquisition about 8-fold. Below, we outline controlled experiments that illustrate the benefits of **individual** improvements. To comprehensively compare the mass-spec data at all levels (including chromatographic separation, precursor abundance, ion isolation, spectral purity, and peptide sequence identification), we include the full [Data-driven Optimization of MS (DO-MS)](https://do-ms.slavovlab.net) reports for each set of experiments.Â
