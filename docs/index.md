## Getting Started

Please read our detailed getting started guides:
* [Getting started on the application]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started-application)
* [Getting started on the command-line]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started-command-line)

### Requirements

This application has been tested on R >= 3.5.0, OSX 10.14 / Windows 7/8/10. R can be downloaded from the main [R Project page](https://www.r-project.org/) or downloaded with the [RStudio Application](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). All modules are maintained for MaxQuant >= 1.6.0.16.

The application suffers from visual glitches when displayed on unsupported older browsers (such as IE9 commonly packaged with RStudio on Windows). Please use IE >= 11, Firefox, or Chrome for the best user experience.

### Installation

Install this application by downloading it from the [release page](https://github.com/SlavovLab/DO-MS/releases/latest).

### Running

The easiest way to run the app is directly through RStudio, by opening the `DO-MS.Rproj` Rproject file

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/do-ms-proj.png){: width="70%" .center-image}

and clicking the "Run App" button at the top of the application, after opening the `server.R` file. We recommend checking the "Run External" option to open the application in your default browser instead of the RStudio Viewer.

You can also start the application by running the `start_server.R` script.

### Automated Report Generation

You can automatically generate PDF/HTML reports without having to launch the server by running the `do-ms_cmd.R` script, like so:

```
$ Rscript do-ms_cmd.R config_file.yaml
```

This requires a configuration file, and you can [find an example one here](https://github.com/SlavovLab/DO-MS/blob/master/example/config_file.yaml). See [Automating Report Generation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/automation) for more details and instructions.

### Customization

DO-MS is designed to be easily user-customizable for in-house proteomics workflows. Please see [Building Your Own Modules]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/build-your-own) for more details.

### Hosting as a Server

Please see [Hosting as a Server]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/hosting-as-server) for more details.

### Search Engines Other Than MaxQuant

This application is currently maintained for MaxQuant >= 1.6.0.16. Adapting to other search engines is possible but not provided out-of-the-box. Please see [Integrating Other Search Engines ]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/other-search-engines) for more details.

### Can I use this for Metabolomics, Lipidomics, etc... ?

While the base library of modules are based around bottom-up proteomics by LC-MS/MS, this project is fundamentally compatible with _any delimited text files_ (CSV, TSV, etc). These implementations will require some programming work, but once it is done DO-MS gives you a extensible framework that can be used over-and-over again to generate shareable reports. See [Integrating Other Search Engines ]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/other-search-engines) for more details
